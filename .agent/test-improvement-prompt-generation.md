# Test Improvement Prompt Generation

Please make sure that @README.md and .agent/project-summary.md and .agent/test-improvement-plan.md are up to date with progress and next steps as appropriate for the purpose of the file. Please add a section in the plan on investigating if we can consolidate the config for our two linting scripts in a way that allows us to pick one, and still get really good linting coverage. Please also add a section for making sure that Black is configured in a way that works with the linter config. Include a section on investigating if the code quality or system design could be improved further by further breaking down the code and tests.

Update the documents, but do not begin implementation

Then write a prompt to allow you to continue the test improvement work in another chat; emphasis starting by fixing the tests, and regularly checking the coverage, linting, types, and the tests
